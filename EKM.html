                    <p>Edappally, about 10 km away from the city, is famous for the St. George Forane Church, one of the oldest Roman Catholic Churches in the State. The church, popularly known as Edappally Pally, was a small structure at the time of its construction in 594 AD. In 1080 AD, a bigger church was built adjacent to the old one to accommodate the congregation that had grown greatly in number. The Edappally pilgrim church was the richest Catholic shrine in Kerala. Due to the uncountable miracles of Edappally St George, the Catholic Church were deciding to elevate this miraculous Church to the status of a National Shrine Basilica.</p>
