                    <p class="card-text">Alappuzha or Alleppey  is the administrative headquarters of Alappuzha district in state of Kerala, India. The Backwaters of Alappuzha are one of the most popular tourist attractions in India which attracts millions of domestic and international tourists.</p>
                    <p>The longest lake in India, Vembanad Lake flows across several districts in Kerala. It is called by several names including Punamada Lake, Kochi Lake, and Vembanadu Lake. Among the major highlights of this lake is Kettuvallams (houseboats), numerous resorts along the banks and the famous Nehru Trophy Boat Race.</p>
                    <p>While this quaint and clean beach sees tourists every now and then, it is still an unspoilt getaway that entices with its peaceful atmosphere. A part of the coastal village of Andhakaranazhi, it is frequented by fishermen, and you can often see large nets spread out to dry. An aerial walkway leading to the beach offers memorable sunset views and is a great spot for feeling the breeze in your hair. Just a word of caution - the water level can be unpredictable. So, if you are not too sure, stick to lazy strolls on the warm sand. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Pandavan Rock derived its name from Pandavas, the five famous brothers in Mahabharata. It is believed that Pandavas stayed inside the cave during their exile. The walk till the rock is quite interesting and it is an amazing place to spend time with family. The stunning view of hills and forests surrounding the rock serve as the perfect backdrop for photography.</p>
